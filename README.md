# Introduction

In this lab, we'll be using the Terraform and ASP.NET MVC code you created in the [previous lab](https://github.com/ecrhoads/InfrastructureAsCode-Lab) to create an automated build/release pipeline. 

## Prereqs
- Azure DevOps account: if you don't have one, go to https://dev.azure.com and create a free account. Use your account from MPN/Visual Studio Subscription.  
- Azure DevOps project: Create a project called DevOpsLab, choose Agile as the process template, and Git as the source control.

## Module 1: Creating a Build Pipeline for Terraform

## Module 2: Releasing to Dev and Prod

## Module 3: Building an ASP.NET MVC App

## Module 4: Updating the Release Pipeline to Deploy Infra & Apps
